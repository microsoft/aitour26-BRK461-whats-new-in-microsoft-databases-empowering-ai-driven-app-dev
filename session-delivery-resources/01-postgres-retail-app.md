[ðŸŽ¬ Watch the video](https://aka.ms/AAy1xkc)

The Zava Tech team is modernizing their Retail App and for this they have created a new app based on an Agentic architecture.

The new AgenticShop is a GenAI-powered e-commerce application that showcases how **multi-agent workflows**, it can drive **personalized product discovery** using unstructured data like user reviews and preferences. This demo runs fully on Azure, and can be deployed quickly using the **Azure Developer CLI**.

Explore how intelligent agents handle search, sentiment, memory, and personalization with observability and memory persistence.

## Why Azure Database for PostgreSQL

* **Open Source:** Leverage a robust AI ecosystem, with leading frameworks offering first-class support for PostgreSQL.
* **Extensible:** Enhance your database with PostgreSQL extensions for vectors, graphs, and more.
* **Managed Service:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL is fully managed, handling backups, patching, scaling, and high availability for you. This allows you to focus on building your application, while Azure takes care of the operational complexities and maintenance tasks.
* **Built-In Intelligence:** Developers can combine scalar, range, and geospatial filters with vector similarity and keyword search in a single query, enabling advanced AI workflows. Azure AI for PostgreSQL also provides seamless integration with Azure OpenAI and other Azure AI services.

## Setup

This demo is prepared to run on Azure. Please note that this demo is **Python only**.
To set up this demo, follow the instructions provided in the [PostgreSQL Agentic Shop](https://aka.ms/postgresql-agentic-shop) repository. Additionally, install the [Visual Studio Code extension for PostgreSQL](https://aka.ms/aitour26-postgres-vscode-extension) and use it in VS Code's agent mode to complete the steps as demonstrated.

## Preparation

In the Browser Open the URL of the Agentic Shop.
In Visual Studio Code connect to the database using the Visual Studio Code extension for PostgreSQL.

### Talking points

* **Open-source:**  

  PostgreSQL offers a robust ecosystem and easy extensibility with open-source extensions for features like vector search and graph support.

* **Agent Architectures with Azure AI Extension for PostgreSQL:**  

  Combine PostgreSQL with the Azure AI extension to enable multi-agent workflows, vector search, and direct integration with Azure AI services like Azure OpenAI. Use familiar SQL to implement semantic search, recommendations, and personalized features within your app.

* **VS Code Extension for PostgreSQL:**  

  Use the Visual Studio Code extension to connect, query, and manage PostgreSQL databases efficiently. It streamlines agentic app development with features like code completion, query history, and integrated AI toolsâ€”all within your development environment.
